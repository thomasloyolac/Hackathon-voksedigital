In This hackathon i got 19 th rank out of 1440 submissions 
in this hackathon i did a lot of feature selection techniques and i tried neural networks and machine learning to solve this problem
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
   Socio-Economic Segregation on the basis of earnings is done by various government bodies across the world by doing a poll which can be
"door to door" or "online based" to identify/keep a check on the sections of society having lower levels of income.

Similarly in the US, it is a requirement for the federal bodies to be cognizant of people's income which falls under a 
threshold so that decisions taken on various fronts can be inclusive and without ambiguity. For this reason 
few federal bodies like the "Bureau Of Economic Analysis" outsource their masked data to 3rd party companies who are kept on contract to analyze the 
data to garner detailed insights and come up with different sets of best 
models to: 
1) decide on a threshold value that can act as a good classification boundary condition.
2) to classify the people in the database based upon this threshold value.

For that reason, you are hired by one such company as an "Analyst" and are provided with the threshold value 
which is decided to be $50k/year.  
The task expected from you is to :
1) perform a detailed EDA to garner insights that can be helpful for the stakeholders.
2) to classify all the people who earn more or less than $50k/year based upon their various demographical features
   by building a generalizable classification model.
